  <h2>My journey</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
      My journey started on a farm in the Northern Cape province.
      How did this farm girl became a Data Scientist.... read on!
      <br>
  </p>
    <p>
        My journey continued, after matriculating, studying B.Sc. in the field of
        Agricultural Economics at the University of the Free State.
        <br>
        I embarked my Agricultural Economic career with the Department of
        Agriculture in Bloemfontein.  Here I dived into the world of economics,
        markets, prices and projects.
        I completed project feasability studies and project management for small 
        scale agricultural projects. 
        <br>
        We hosted farmer days to help upcomming farmers how to identify their 
        target markets and how to deliver their products to their customers.
        <br>
        These projects broaden my knowledge and skills for project management,
        market research and analysis, gathering and analyzing of data.
    </p>
    <p>After this, life happend, took me on a different path, one that led to
      Data Science and Hyperiondev.  I learned my first programming language --
      Python.  Then I moved on to Machine learning and Deep Learning. <br>
      Currently I am doing the Software Engineering Bootcamp.
      The biggest surprise for me was....I love this!!
