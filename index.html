        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I am a qualified Agricultural Economist. I have a BSc.Agric.Hon 
            degree in Economics and Agricultural Economics. I grew up on a farm
            and love everything about the outdoors and farm life. 
            Now....how did this farm girl turned into a Data Scientist, I wonder...
        </p>
        <p>
            Life happened. I did a Career change in 2022 and never looked
            back! I learned a new Programming language, completed my Data Science
            Bootcamp with Hyperiondev and I am very proud of this achievement! 
            I used my financial and economic background to further enhance my 
            analytical and data science skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, a farm girl that became a data scientist... I know!

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am a newly converted programmer/coder. Yes, I have made the leap 
            into the Tech Industry.
            Honestly speaking, I am loving it! I started this journey with 
            the Data Science Bootcamp @Hyperiondev. This was my introduction 
            to Python and coding. The biggest surprise for me was that 
            I never thought that I would enjoy learning to code this much!
        </p>

        <p>
            I was privileged to attend workshops held by experts from Canada in the respective
            fields of animal husbandry and marketing of agricultural products.
            I then thought to spread my wings and went to the U.S.A! Here I worked
            on an organic farm. This was a wonderful experience, one that I enjoyed
            immensely! Here I worked with people from all over the world like 
            Brazil, Mexico and Europe.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then I did a PGCE, through UNISA as a back-up. I taught maths and maths
            literacy for Grade 8 and maths literacy for Grade 10-12. Here I saw what
            an impact teaching can have.
            That is why, currently at Hyperiondev I love teaching students about 
            the wonderful world of coding while upskilling myself to become 
            the best Data Scientist that I can be!
        </p>

        <p>
            Please join me on this exciting journey!
        </p>

            Ciao!<br>
