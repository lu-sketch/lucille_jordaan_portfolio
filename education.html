    <h1>Educational Background</h1>
</header>
<br>
<h3>Data Science Bootcamp - 2022 </h3>
<p> My latest education experience was in 2022.  I decided to do a career 
  from economics and finance into Data Science.  My existing experience in
  Economics and finance, I see as a great foundation for Data Science and 
  later moving into Bussiness analytics.

<h3>Software enginnering Bootcamp - 2024</h3>
<p>
  Currently I am enrolled in the Software Engineering Bootcamp at Hyperiondev.
  I am working on tasks and projects where I learn to develop websites.
  I am very exited about this! It brings out my creative side.  I love 
  developing websites where you can see it take shape before your eyes
  and that you can literally change anything into the vision that you have
  for the website.
  <br>
  <p>
    In my first project I used HTML and CSS to devolep a portfolio website.
    Then I moved on to work with the following frameworks;
    <br> Bootstrap and Django.
